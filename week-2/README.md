## Learning Log
### What I learned
I learned about how to use Javascript to change CSS, along with conditionals in Codex.io.
I also learned about Style systems and how to best apply them.
### What was hard
finding out that apparently changes done outside of the code space do not update into the codespace without deleating it and making a new one.
Also migraines are very annoying when they have aura that keeps me from using the computer T^T.
### How I used AI
I did not use AI.
### What is still unclear
Everything makes sense for the most part.
