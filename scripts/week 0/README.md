# Week 0 Learning log
## what I learned:
I learned some of the basics of JavaScript.
I learned that // is used for single line comments and /* is used for multi-line comments.
I leanred that console.log is very important to bug test as it can run small sections of code at a time and return their values to easily be able to check where an error is.
I learned that JavaScripts is actually different than Java, and that the two although are similar in name, are different programming languages.
I learned that to avoid errors when commiting and syncing, I need to create the base file and commit just that first, then add the code. It is quite odd but not too much of a hassle, I will just veiw it as that I need to save often.
I also learned that github has a function to un-commit something, which will be great when fixing large errors that are better to just restart over than nitpick.
I learned that in java, variables can be re-assigned strings mid-code to change the output, allowing for the same variable to be called with a new responce, without the need to create thousands of variables.
I learned I can edit my md files outside of a code space if I wish. 
I learned that since I last used Github, they added a better blame system then before.
I learned as well that applying for github education is very complicated and will likely take many many tries to do each time I need to renew.
