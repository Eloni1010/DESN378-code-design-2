## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
<!-- Design tokens, state vs appearance, system preference, persistence -->
I learned about design systems, states and how to change them, and how to give the system memory.
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
figma was a bit wonky on putting variables into categories, but i figured it out quickly.
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
Did not use Ai
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
​Why github still won't let me edit multiple files at one time without breaking. not too big of an issue though, just means I have to save fruequently.
