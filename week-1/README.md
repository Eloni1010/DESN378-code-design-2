# Learning Log
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I learned that much of my Ux 1 and current UX 2 class will come in handy for this class. I also learned that it is much faster to take notes using multiple pens instead of using a multi-nib pen.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Tech issues T^T My laptop has been having a persistant bug of disconnecting from the internet and it takes a few seconds to get back online.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I don't feel comfortable using generative ai, with the environmental impacts and how most llms are trained on stolen data, I cannot in good concious use them. (I personally had artwork and writing scrapped without my permission.)
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Why Github is still being rude with not letting me commit changes in multiple files at a time? I have to save so very frequently.
